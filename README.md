# word-guess-game

Welcome to the Wierd Al Word Game. Here, players will guess the names of the songs in a hangman type format.

Here are the rules:
* Each word has a 3 wrong word limit that, when reached, will result in the game ending.
* If a puzzle is solved, a reward for your hardwork pops up.
  * In the background a new puzzle will load. Once you have finished enjoying your reward just close that window and begin the next round
* Wins will be shown and will increase with each correct word spelling.
* Points are not taken away for repeated correct guesses.
